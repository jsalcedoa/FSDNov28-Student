Clone git repository

In this lab we will learn how to clone a git repository, as well as how to use Git UI


Lab Goals:

1. Initialize git repository
2. Install Git UI
3. Clone on the command line and in the UI

The instructor will prepare a common repository on GitHub, and it will be used for training.
(If the student group has an internal repository already, the labs will be done in it).

== STEP 1)  Clone git repository.

    The following steps are done in Git Bash if in Windows, and on Terminal, if in Mac/Linux

	$ git clone <url>

(The instructor will provide the URL, but we will call it git-labs for now)

	$ cd git-labs

	Investigate the contents of the git-labs directory

== STEP 2) Install your favorite git UI

	This may be an Eclipse plugin, IDEA or NetBeans plugin,
	UI that comes with Git install, SmartGit or any other client of your choice

	If you don't plan to use a UI, you can skip this step

== STEP 3) Clone the git-labs project in the git UI

	Follow the instructions of the particular UI
