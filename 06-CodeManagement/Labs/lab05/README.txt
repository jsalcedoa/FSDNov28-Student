Basic git workflow

In this lab we will learn the basics of normal git workflow, by imitating a developer's day


Lab Goals:

1. Imitate morning work
2. Imitate emergency fix
3. Go back to normal work

By now, you should have sufficient knowledge of basic git command, in order to re-enact the scenario below
Please refer back to the slides for more detail

== STEP 1)  Morning 

	Create your 'new-work' branch
	Work in this branch for a while

== STEP 2) Lunch

	Emergency fix in the 'master' is required

	Perform and test the fix
	Merge the fix into master
	Test, push the master to remote
	Delete the 'hotfix' branch
